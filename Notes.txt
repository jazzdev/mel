----
Use USERS command to find list of logged in users.
Or use WHOIS command find if a given user is logged in.

Create a directory for each user and in that dir put
a file for each message with the timestamp as the filename.

WHOIS jd
:922jdbrennan.local 311 bot jd ~JD localhost * :JD Brennan
:922jdbrennan.local 312 bot jd 922jdbrennan.local :Server Info Text
:922jdbrennan.local 319 bot jd :@#Foo #Martini
:922jdbrennan.local 317 bot jd 361 1351802484 :seconds idle, signon time
:922jdbrennan.local 318 bot jd :End of WHOIS list
WHOIS kjasdf
:922jdbrennan.local 401 bot kjasdf :No such nick or channel name
:922jdbrennan.local 318 bot kjasdf :End of WHOIS list

Could use the channels list to say something to a user in a different
channel (instead of waiting for them to rejoin current channel).

handeMessage { nick: 'jd',
  user: '~JD',

  realname: 'JD Brennan',
  server: '922jdbrennan.local',
